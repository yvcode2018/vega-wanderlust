                    <p>I am overwhelmed by wanderlust, and want to see the entire world, but there are certain locations that are "bucket list" items. Kenya was on that list, and for my 40th birthday I splurged on an unforgettable Kenyan adventure.</p>
                    <p>Kenya is magnificent. I can't say that enough.  Utterly magnificent.  The first time I saw a massive bull elephant stroll past me at the <a href="https://www.samburu.net/" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Samburu National Reserve</strong></a>, my heart skipped a beat and I was at a loss for words.  When the lioness and her mate were no more than 2 feet from my open sided Jeep, I was simultaneously excited and frightened.  Visiting a Samburu tribe awakened me to the life in the world, and watching the great migration of the wildebeest from an air balloon in the Masai Mara at dawn enlivened me. It's been almost a year, and I still miss falling asleep to the songs of hippos.</p>
                    <p>Although I was mesmerized by the Samburu National Reserve and the Masai Mara, Nairobi also left me in awe.  My eyes welled with tears at the <a href="https://www.sheldrickwildlifetrust.org/" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>David Sheldrick sanctuary</strong></a> when the orphaned baby elephants pridefully paraded before me.  A piece of my heart was captured by sweet giraffe kisses at the <a href="https://www.thesafaricollection.com/properties/giraffe-manor/" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Giraffe Manor</strong></a>.</p>
                    <p>Go to Kenya. Just go.   You'll have no regrets.</p>

                    <h3>Morocco</h3>
                    <div class="img-card"><a href="#morocco"><img src="images/morocco.jpeg" class="imgspec"></a></div>
                    <h4>by Tara</h4>
                    <p>My visit to Morocco was quite an ambitious one, and led me to 3 beautiful locations dispersed throughout its vast terrain  - Marrakech, the Sahara, and Chefchaouen.  I did not have much time to visit Morocco - only a little over a week - but was able to make an overzealous itinerary a reality that I will never forget.</p>
                    <p>I began my Moroccan adventure with a few independent days of absorbing all of the wonderful sites, sounds and tastes of Marrakech.  I relished in the sensory overload and hospitality, especially those of my hosts at Riad Al Badia.   A piece of advice when visiting Morocco - take advantage of the opportunity to stay at riads lest you will miss out on quite an experience.</p>  
                    <p>When I was ready (well, really forced) to part ways with Marrakech, Jamal from <a href="http://www.mintteatours.com/" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Mint Tea Tours</strong></a> swept me away to the Sahara for a night at a desert camp.  Unbeknownst to me, my travel partner (despite advice to the contrary) reserved us a 3 hour afternoon camel ride to the <a href="http://www.merzougaluxurydesertcamps.com/" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Merzouga Luxury Desert Camp</strong></a>.   While I highly recommend taking a camel ride, I speak from experience that 3 hours in the peak of the afternoon heat is 2.5 hours too long! When I arrived at the camp, I was overheated and sore, but the wonderful staff, delicious food and amazing sunset made that all go away.</p>
                    <p>The next morning we began our trek to Chefchaouen, which took over 2 days.  Jamal, being the wonderful guide that he is, didn't want us to remember Morrocco as a very long car ride, and made sure that we got to experience the beautiful country along the way by stopping at a plethora of interesting sites and introducing us to local cuisine.  En route to the Blue City, we stopped at Fez for a night of rest at Dar Bensouda, and had the amazing opportunity to dine at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293733-d1598678-Reviews-Restaurant_dar_hatim-Fes_Fes_Boulemane_Region.html" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Restaurant dar Hatim</strong></a> - which is operated out of someone's home.  I was mesmerized by the limited time that I spent in the Fez medina, and will definitely make a visit there a priority the next time I am in Morocco.</p>  
                    <p>After days of driving, we finally arrived at Chefchaouen,  and were truly overwhelmed by all of its splendor - from the vast array of blue blanketing the city, to the glorious sounds of the calls to prayer.  Our visit to Morocco would have been more "comfortable" had we not insisted on visiting the Blue City, but the experience definitely would not have been the same.  I cannot express how magical that city is, and encourage anyone visiting Morocco to experience it - even if it means going out of the way.</p>
