                    <p>Las Vegas is one of my favorite vacation spots. I'm all about the gambling, shows and pools. Sure you can get these things outside of Vegas, but there, it's done with glamor, style and class. While I'm at a roulette table, I see interesting people - from dressed up high rollers to jeans and T-shirt's. Outside on the strip, there are loud people, crazy people, people to gawk out and just bizarre things you don't really see everyday (like a guy in front of the <a href="https://www.bellagio.com/en.html" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Bellagio</strong></a> with a baby alligator and snake). The pools are out of this world, some are huge and extensive with wave pools and lazy rivers, while others are calm, serene and beautiful. You can never be bored in Las Vegas and it's got such a variety of shows that there's something for everyone. Yep, my favorite place... Vegas!</p>

                    <p>Oh....what can I say about Las Vegas? It's suppose to be the "Disneyworld" for adults. "What happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas" is the motto....</p>
                    <p>With that being said, I'll share a bit of my birthday experience in Las Vegas. Though I have passed through there many times before, I never truly had the "Vegas" experience.  So I decided to do a destination birthday with my closest/party animal friends.  Unlike most, I decided to spend about a week in Vegas (no one should really spend a week in Vegas...).  It worked out best because my friends flew in and out at different points of my vacation.</p> 
                    <p>During my first day there, two of my friends met up with me at the <a href="https://slslasvegas.com/" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>SLS hotel</strong></a> (we were only stood for one night).  The daytime was a typical walk through the strip, eat lunch, gamble and nap (that was absolutely essential).   Following a quick shower and wardrobe change, we went to the <a href= https://www.caesars.com/planet-hollywood” target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino</strong></a>. My friend, Nina, treated me to see Britney's Piece of Me concert residency. Our other friend decided that wasn't for him and took advantage of some solo time in the casinos. Britney definitely still knows how to put on a show! From there we met up with some old friends for dinner and decided to go to the Paris hotel to party under the "Eiffel Tower." As for the rest of the night, I'm not sure what happened.  &#128554;</p>
                    <p>The following day, my cousin flew in....and now we were four.  At that point, we had to move to a larger room, so we got fancy and booked a room at the <a href=" https://www.venetian.com/" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Venetian</strong></a> for the rest of the trip. The rooms in the Venetian are the size of a small apartment and absolutely gorgeous. One of the best hotels I've had the pleasure of staying in (travel tip: best hotel for a group). This was the start of the "sleeping in late" phase. Once we got up, we did the usual daytime routine (that was our relax time). That evening, we decided to take in a show, <a href=" https://www.cirquedusoleil.com/zumanity " target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Cirque du Soleil's Zumanity</strong></a>. Have to say that was definitely one of the more provocative Cirque shows I've seen! I can't say I remember where we went to dinner (some of the trip is a still hazy) but I know went to some of the more well-known restaurants and got our "fancy" on some nights. We then continued the rest of our night at, <a href=" https://www.taolasvegas.com/" target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Tao</strong></a> nightclub until the wee hours.</p>
                    <p>Friday is here!! The weekend in Vegas begins now! Let's just go straight to the evening….Nina and I decided to have girl time for a bit at the male revue, <a href=" https://www.excalibur.com/en/entertainment/thunder-from-down-under.html " target="_blank" class="paralink"><strong>Thunder from Down Under</strong></a>.  Now I know why so many bachelorette parties are held in Vegas (Magic Mike I'm coming for you next!). Eventually, we had to meet up with the guys because we had one more friend flying in late that evening. And now we were five...  My friend got to the hotel just in time to drop off his luggage and change clothes because then we were off to one of the nightclub to watch Alesso perform. Out of the entire week, I have to say that was the best night for me because it was the one and only night I had everyone together.  The rest of the weekend was mostly partying and discovering some of the what the other hotels had to offer. But with each day, we lost a member of our crew. By Sunday night, my last night, it was just 3 of us and we decided to see Criss Angel. In my opinion, save your money.  He only did one amazing thing in the entire show.  The rest of the night was spent drinking and gambling until the morning light (with lots of regrets on the way to the airport).  And that is how you can spend a week in Las Vegas!</p>
